## TIC-TAC-TOE

The brief was to code a HTML DOM of tic-tac-toe so that users could input the X and O with colour changes to make it visually clearer.

### Challenges

This was an incredibly difficult task and I had difficulty finding the *.data("")* selector that would have helped me early on.
The method used is very hard coded.

This would be an interesting task to revisit with additional knowledge and experience to see how I would be able to complete it.
